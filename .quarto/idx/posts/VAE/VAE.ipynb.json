In fact, to get an idea of the complexity of the dynamics let us plot what some of these sensor readings may look like. We will say the spring mass system is modelled as,\n\n$$\n    z(t) = z_0 \\text{cos}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} t\\right)\n$$\nwhere we will simply assume, $z_0=k=m=1$ (initial position, spring constant and mass equal 1).\nFor plotting what the sensor reading may look like, we will assume that the sensors are randomly located around the spring-mass system. The sensors will return the distance between the mass and the sensor as it is in motion. Hence, we will randomly define the Cartesian coordinates of the sensors in the room and simply take the distance between the moving spring-mass system and the sensor locations as the sensor outputs. \n\n\nWe get some relatively weird looking data at least compared to the simple oscillating motion we would get if we only looked at the z-axis motion. The aim of the VAE is to find that simple oscillating motion from the data collected by all these sensors. With this simple system that we can compress all the input data $X$ into a more simple latent space $Z$. In this latent space the motion isn't as complex and only requires 1 axis to fully describe the motion. The idea of the VAE is to represent high dimensional data in a representative latent space $Z$ which tries to efficiently encode the input data into a lower dimensional space (in this case the latent space $Z$ would fully be able to describe the motion of the system). But how does the VAE do this? \n\n## The Components of the VAE \n\nThe VAE is a generative model. This means instead of simply learning an input $\\rightarrow$ output relationship e.g. $f(X) = Z$ or using probability distributions $p(Z|X)$, we learn the joint probability between the inputs and latent variables $p(X,Z)$. This allows us to transfer from one space to another as $p(X,Z) = p(Z|X)p(X)=p(X|Z)p(Z)$ it also lets us generate inputs $X$ simply by sampling the latent space $Z$ and using $p(X|Z)$ to generate new inputs $X$. But how does the VAE do this? \n\nFirstly, if the goal is to model the joint distribution $p(X,Z)$ which can be described using $p(X,Z) = p(Z|X)p(X)=p(X|Z)p(Z)$, then since this is deep learning, let us model what we can using neural networks. We then have,\n\n* $p(Z|X) = q_{\\phi}(Z|X)$ is the encoder network as it encodes inputs to the latent space. $\\phi$ are the parameters of the network and in most cases it models a Gaussian/Normal distribution by making the network output a mean and log-variance i.e. $q_{\\phi}(Z|X) = [\\mu_z, \\text{log}\\sigma_z^2]$\n* $p(X|Z) = p_{\\theta_x}(X|Z)$ is the decoder as it takes latent variables and transforms them back into the input space. The network parameters are $\\theta_x$ and it models a Gaussian distribution like the encoder \n* $p(Z) = p_{\\theta_z}(Z)$ for VAEs this isn't usually a network but instead we define it as a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0,I)$. The idea behind this is that we constain the latent space to this domain so after training we don't need the encoder to tell us where the latent variables exist. Instead, we just sample from the defined distribution $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ and decode to the input space to generate new input data. \n* $p(X)$ this is the distribution of the input data, we don't know what this is and that is the motivation for trying our very best to get rid of it in any formula we see (out of sight out of mind). We will use all sorts of mathematical tricks to derive a loss function which does not include this term. \n\nTo train the VAE first notice that the encoding distribution can be expressed in the following form.\n\n$$\n    p(Z|X) = \\frac{p(X|Z)p(Z)}{p(X)}\n$$\n\nSince we don't know what $p(X)$ is we use variational techniques to estimate the unknown distribution $p(Z|X)$ using a simpler distribution (usually a Gaussian distribution). Hence, we have,\n\n$$\n    p(Z|X) \\approx q_{\\phi}(Z|X) = [\\mu_z, \\text{log}\\sigma_z^2] \\rightarrow \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_z, \\sigma_z^2)\n$$\n\nTo derive the loss (known as the Evidence Lower Bound or ELBO) we try to minimise the difference between the simple distribution $q_\\phi(Z|X)$ and the complex unknown $p(Z|X)$. \ni.e.\n$$\n    D_{KL}(q_\\phi(Z|X)||p(Z|X))\n$$\nWhere $D_{KL}$ is the KL-divergance. \n\nThere are many resources which derive the ELBO, so I won't go over the mathematical details. I will however show the final form of the ELBO and discuss the logic behind each term so that it may become clear how we can later leverage this to learn the latent dynamics of the system (when looking at DVAEs). \n\n$$\n    \\text{ELBO} = \\mathbb{E}_{q_{\\phi}(Z|X)}\\left[\\text{log} p_{\\theta_x}(X|Z)\\right] - D_{KL}\\left( q_{\\phi}(Z|X) || p(Z)\\right)\n$$\n\nTo optimise this we maximise the ELBO (or we minimise the -ELBO) loss by tuning the parameters network parameters $\\phi$ and $\\theta_x$. Let's look at the first term,\n$$\n    \\mathbb{E}_{q_{\\phi}(Z|X)}\\left[\\text{log} p_{\\theta_x}(X|Z)\\right]\n$$ \n\nThis is the log-likelihood which determines the likelihood of the decoded latent variable $Z$ to match the target input $X$. This is what we might think of when we think of a traditional or basic loss function; is the output of our network close to the target output we expect. The more interesting term here is the second one, \n\n$$\n    D_{KL}\\left( q_{\\phi}(Z|X) || p(Z)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis term optimises $q_{\\phi}(Z|X)$ to encode the latent variables $Z$ into a defined space $p(Z)$ (for VAEs this is commonly described using the standard normal distribution). This means an optimised VAE has a latent space constrained to the prior distribution $p(Z)$. Hence, we could theoretically design a simple prior (this is what we do by picking a standard normal distribution) and simplify the latent space, so it is easy to interpret.\n\n## Problems \n\nFor learning the underlying dynamics of sequential input data the VAE is not the ideal model. One problem we have is that $Z$ and $X$ are fixed lengths. If we want to learn the dynamics we don't it is not very useful if we can only deal with sequences of a certain arbitrary length that we choose to train with. \ne.g. if we trained with input time-series sequences of length $T$, $X = [x_1,...,x_T]$, then we can only reconstruct other $X$ variables of the same length. Hence, if $X$ denotes a list of positions then we are only outputting possible positions the spring-mass system could be in and not understanding the physics or dynamics behind how those positions came about. \nSo VAEs can handle \"static\" cases where the data is a fixed length or size (e.g. generating images). However, if we want to learn the dynamics of the system we need to be able to handle the dynamic case. In this dynamic case the data could have different sequence lengths, but even if it isn't, we don't want to just learn all the possible positions of the spring-mass system, we also want to understand the underlying dynamics that determine how those positions change over time. \nAnother problem is the prior of the VAE is generally a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance (standard Normal distribution). This is not ideal if we want to learn a sequence as the latent space has no sequential structure. If we use a standard Normal distribution then we are trying to construct a latent sequence which consists of sequences of randomly generated variables that have no relation to each other with respect to time i.e. \n\n$$\n    z_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I})\n$$\n\nHence, the latent space consists of sequences $\\{z_t\\}_{t=0}^T$ where each $z_t$ was randomly generated and is not related to any other $z_t$ variable. This type of prior is not conducive to building structured latent dynamics. But what can be done to tackle these problems? \n\nWhat we want is to replace the components of the VAE so it looks something like this, \n\n* Encoder: $q_{\\phi}(Z|X) = q_{\\phi}(z_t|z_{1:t-1},x_{1:t})$ (later when looking at DVAEs we will learn this isn't quite right)\n* Decoder: $p_{\\theta_x}(X|Z) = p_{\\theta_x}(x_t|x_{1:t-1}, z_{1:t})$\n* Prior: $p(Z) = p_{\\theta_z}(z_t|z_{t-1})$\n\nWe could then design some simple prior dynamics and given an initial $z_0$ use $p_{\\theta_z}(z_t|z_{t-1})$ to generate any sequence of arbitrary length. To design a VAE that does this is known as a DVAE and we will see that it is just the VAE but simplified (mathematically speaking not conceptually) to deal with sequences. \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n> Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been covered in many different texts and blog posts.
